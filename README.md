## Documentation

The website is statically generated by Jekyll. It (currently) must be manually built before deployment.
There is only one page. The artist box and marquee compoments are located in `/_includes`. Join links
and artist data is located in `/_data`. There is one main stylesheet located under `/_sass`. Images are located at `/assets/images`.

Files from the old website are located in `/site` and are included when the site is built. For more information on how to use Jekyll and update the site, see the Jekyll documentation: https://jekyllrb.com/

## Notes

To set this up (only needs to be done once at repository creation), associate the repo and the website directory this way:

```bash
cd  /mit/mpc/web_scripts/
svn checkout https://github.com/richardliutl/mpc/trunk/site
```

To set up tooling (pandoc) run tools.sh. Should be set up so that /tools and /site are siblings.

```bash
mkdir -p tools;
wget -qO- https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/download/2.11.0.4/pandoc-2.11.0.4-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar xvzf - --strip-components 1 -C ./tools/;
```
