         <p class="c4"><span class="c8">How to Discover New Music</span></p>
         <p class="c4 c3"><span class="c8"></span></p>
         <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ever accidentally discover an AMAZING song, only to realize that it&rsquo;s from a small artist you don&rsquo;t recognize? Discovering music like this can feel like you just struck gold before anyone else has; like you found an artist you really vibe with that you would have never otherwise heard. It&rsquo;s a great feeling and it gives us something new to listen to - whether that be new lyrics, a new style, or a new genre. In other words, discovering music expands our tastes and gives us cool new tracks we can force our friends to listen to. But more than anything, discovering new music is FUN! In this article, I want to share some of my favorite ways to discover new music and artists so that you can have some fun with these methods and learn more about your own music tastes.</span></p>
         <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
         <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The first thing you should know about discovering music is: Friday. Friday is the magic day for the music industry, because statistics about song plays for a week are reset every Friday. So if you released a song on a Tuesday, you would only have three days count toward the first week&rsquo;s number of plays, as opposed to seven if you had released it on Friday. That&rsquo;s why most artists have gravitated to releasing their songs and albums on Fridays.</span></p>
         <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
         <p class="c1"><span class="c0">What this means is that every Friday, there&rsquo;s an entire catalogue of new music just waiting for you to discover. Spotify packages this in two palatable forms - New Music Friday and Release Radar. New Music Friday (NMF) is a Spotify playlist that is updated every Friday with new songs from top artists released that day. Here&rsquo;s what this week&rsquo;s NMF looks like:</span></p>
         <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
         <p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 410.50px; height: 326.29px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 410.50px; height: 326.29px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p>
         <p class="c4"><span class="c2">This week&rsquo;s New Music Friday playlist. It has 99 songs (!) and lasts almost 5 and a half hours (!!)</span></p>
         <p class="c4 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
         <p class="c1"><span class="c0">NMF is great for finding new music being recognized by top playlist makers in the music industry, but there&rsquo;s just way too much stuff (this week has 99 songs!). Fortunately, Spotify has addressed this by creating a Release Radar playlist customized for you every Friday, populated with new releases from artists you listen to. And unlike NMF, you&rsquo;ll only find songs from artists you&rsquo;ve listened to before. Here&rsquo;s what my Release Radar looks like for this week:</span></p>
         <p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 420.07px; height: 340.71px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 420.07px; height: 340.71px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p>
         <p class="c4"><span class="c7">My Release Radar playlist for this week. It has 30 songs and all of the artists in here are familiar to me.</span></p>
         <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
         <p class="c1"><span class="c0">So now you can stay on top of new releases from your favorite artists with Release Radar! I think this is such an underappreciated way to discover music. One of the highlights of my Fridays now is sitting back and playing through my Release Radar playlist. It really keeps you up to date with the music you care about rather than what the radio wants to feed you. One thing to note is that for Release Radar to give you good recommendations, you need to have listened to stuff on your Spotify account beforehand. So if you&rsquo;ve never used Spotify, I recommend listening to some of your favorite artists on there first, so the algorithm learns about your tastes.</span></p>
         <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
         <p class="c1"><span>An extension of this is Spotify&rsquo;s Discover Weekly playlist. As you might guess from the name, this is a customized playlist generated weekly (on Mondays) geared toward exposing you to new artists and songs that are similar to things you listen to. I love listening to my Discover Weekly on weekdays in between classes and always find new artists and songs that I love in the process. While Release Radar shows you music from artists you already know, Discover Weekly is more ambitious by showing you music from artists you don&rsquo;t know, who are often small and growing. By </span><span>checking</span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;new artists this way, you&rsquo;re both supporting rising talent and expanding your taste in music, which is awesome!</span></p>
         <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
         <p class="c1"><span>Another neat tool to discover new artists is Music-Map (</span><span class="c5"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.music-map.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1603587432487000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3iufCHpCFGRYghqJcuwra6">www.music-map.com/</a></span><span class="c0">). All you do is type in an artist you like, and the website shows you a map of similar artists you&rsquo;re likely to enjoy. Here&rsquo;s what a search for Ed Sheeran gave me:</span></p>
         <p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 548.50px; height: 288.31px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 548.50px; height: 288.31px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p>
         <p class="c4"><span class="c7">A Music-Map artist similarity search for &ldquo;Ed Sheeran&rdquo;. A little surprised Justin Bieber didn&rsquo;t make it...</span></p>
         <p class="c4 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
         <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Let&rsquo;s say now Shawn Mendes catches my eye. I can then click on Shawn Mendes, and see all the artists similar to him, and so on. So you can go down a rabbit hole exploring this website. I found it really interesting to type in one of my favorite artists and notice how many of my other favorite artists also popped up as similar. I learned that my favorite artists group into two main clusters - an R&amp;B cluster (Blackbear, Bazzi, etc.) and a future bass cluster (Illenium, Porter Robinson, etc.), and I discovered new artists within those clusters that I&rsquo;ve been checking out and loving. So I definitely recommend checking out Music-Map, both for finding new artists and also to just learn more about your music taste.</span></p>
         <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
         <p class="c1"><span>One final thing I want to touch on is monthly playlists. Let&rsquo;s say you check out all the things mentioned in this article and find a bunch of songs you like. How do you remember these songs and share them with others? The answer is playlists</span><span>, </span><span>but how exactly should you use them? One way that I&rsquo;ve found to be rewarding is making </span><span class="c10">monthly playlists</span><span class="c0">. Each month, I start a new playlist, and over the course of the month, I add any songs that I really like to the playlist. It&rsquo;s super easy and helps me keep a record of the music I listen to. Here&rsquo;s what my monthly playlists from late 2019 and early 2020 look like:</span></p>
         <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
         <p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 413.50px; height: 360.49px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 413.50px; height: 360.49px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p>
         <p class="c4"><span class="c7">My monthly playlists from Sept. 2019 to April 2020.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;The covers are so cool!</span><sup><a href="#cmnt2" id="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup></p>
         <p class="c4 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
         <p class="c1"><span>The advantage of this over having one big playlist of all my songs is that I can see how my music tastes have changed over time and feel some nostalgia. Sometimes I&rsquo;ll listen to old playlists for a nice blast to the past. I can remember which artists I was listening to back then and wonder what I was going through to have added &ldquo;i hate u, i love u&rdquo; to my playlist five time</span><span>s. </span><sup><a href="#cmnt3" id="cmnt_ref3">[c]</a></sup><span class="c0">And it&rsquo;s also really nice to have chronological playlists, each representing a segment of your life, almost like they&rsquo;re different chapters of a book. A little melodramatic, but you should definitely give it a shot if this resonates with you!</span></p>
         <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
         <p class="c1"><span class="c0">So these are the best ways I&rsquo;ve found for discovering music. The goal of this article is to help you think about listening to music not just as passively appreciating songs, but also as actively learning about what you do and don&rsquo;t like. By looking for new music constantly, you&rsquo;ll build on your love for music and develop a unique set of tastes. And you can do that concretely by setting aside some time weekly to go through your Release Radar and Discover Weekly, looking at related artists with Music-Map, and tracking your musical journey through monthly playlisting. </span></p>
         <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
         <p class="c1"><span>I hope you learned something new from this you can add to your current listening habits</span><span>!</span><sup><a href="#cmnt4" id="cmnt_ref4">[d]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;</span><span>If you have other interesting ways you discover music, reach out and let us know at </span><span class="c5"><a class="c11" href="mailto:mit-mpc-exec@mit.edu">mit-mpc-exec@mit.edu</a></span><span>!
